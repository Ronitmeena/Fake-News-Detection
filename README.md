Description:
A web-based machine learning application that detects whether news articles are real or fake using Natural Language Processing. Initially implemented using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, the model was upgraded to BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for improved accuracy and contextual understanding.

Key Features:

1.Classifies news as REAL or FAKE in real-time.

2.BERT-based model trained on a labeled dataset for higher accuracy.

3.Live news URL scanning â€” fetches and analyzes article text using Requests + BeautifulSoup.

4.Trusted source verification to reduce false positives.

5.Streamlit-based UI for a clean, interactive interface.

6.Fully integrated with GitHub for version control.

Tech Stack:
-Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT), Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Git, GitHub.
